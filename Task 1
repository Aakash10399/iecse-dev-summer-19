Hey guys!
So seeing most of you are done, we will start off with the **Python Warm-Up Task**.

For this Task we need you to **recreate the Criss-Cross** game using Python!
It is supposed to be a **simple console/terminal based game** where the board is displayed after each move.

The sole purpose of this task is to make you get used to Python so we would highly encourage you to **use functions for various tasks** such as move() , winner() and any other place where you can implement modularity.

You will soon receive GitHub invitations so look out for them.
After you've completed the Task you need to push them to your OWN branches in a folder named 'Task 1'

In case the Medium articles for GitHub were too intimidating we are posting a few pdfs which could help you out.
Again, in case of any queries we would highly encourage you all to discuss it in the group.

You have till Saturday to complete this task.\
