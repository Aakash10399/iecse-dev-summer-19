# Current Task
Hey guys!
Before we can begin with the tasks, there are a few things we would be needing. Here's a list to help you out
- *Python 3* ( https://www.python.org/ ) with *Flask* dependencies ( http://flask.pocoo.org/ )
- *Postman* ( https://www.getpostman.com/ )
- A text editor of your choice
- Github Student Pack, required for bonus deployment tasks ( https://education.github.com/pack )

For further python related work we would need you to get used to the concept of *virtual environments*

I realize most of you are starting out with Python, it's not a huge deal honestly you'll get used to it really quick.
To get you started, you can get your *Python basics* cleared up here

*We're expecting you all will be done by Thursday.*
We will be releasing a simple task on Thursday to warm-up your python skills.

If you have any doubts we would *highly encourage* you to discuss it in the group itself.

Acknowledge this message with your Github IDs.
